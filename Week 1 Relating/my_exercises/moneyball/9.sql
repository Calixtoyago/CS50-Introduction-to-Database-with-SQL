--What salaries are other teams paying? In 9.sql, write a SQL query to find the 5 lowest paying teams (by average salary) in 2001.

--Round the average salary column to two decimal places and call it “average salary”.
--Sort the teams by average salary, least to greatest.
--Your query should return a table with two columns, one for the teams’ names and one for their average salary.

SELECT "teams"."name", ROUND(AVG("salary"), 2) as "average salary"
FROM "salaries"
JOIN "teams" ON "salaries"."team_id" = "teams"."id"
WHERE "salaries"."year" = 2001
GROUP BY "team_id"
ORDER BY "average salary"
LIMIT 5
